# Classic File Transfer with Chunk Handling, Sequence Numbers and Verification

This project demonstrates a client-server file transfer system where:

-The client sends an entire file to the server.

-The server splits the file into smaller chunks, assigns each chunk a sequence number, and sends these chunks back to the client.

-The client reassembles the chunks in the correct order and verifies the integrity of the reassembled file using a checksum.

## ðŸš€ Features:
- **Reliable file transfer** with acknowledgment (ACK) handling for each chunk.
- **Checksum verification** to ensure file integrity during transfer.
- **Robust error handling** to manage unexpected data formats or connection issues.
- **Sequential reassembly** of file chunks to match original file order.
- **Error Detection**: Displays an error message if missing or corrupted data is detected.

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure:
- `client.py`: The client-side script that sends the file.
- `server.py`: The server-side script that receives the file.

## Configuration
-`BUFFER_SIZE`: Size of each chunk sent by the server. Default is 1024 bytes (1KB).

-`SERVER_ADDRESS`: The IP and port where the server listens (127.0.0.1:12345).
## ðŸ›  How to Run:

### Step 1: Start the Server
Open a terminal window and run the following command to start the server:
### step 2:start the client
```bash
python server.py

python client.py
